However as your application grows you may run into a situation when most distant child needs state or an action being passed from root parent component. \n\n```javascript\n<RootParent>\n  <NestedChild>\n    <DeeperNestedChild>\n      < TheDeepestChild />   <-- This component nees actions/state from root parent\n    </DeeperNestedChild>\n  </NestedChild>\n</RootParent>\n```\nThis is called \"Props Drilling\". Passing props down the component tree to child that needs it.\n\nSo, as a Developer you need to recognise moments like that and understand that maintaining that type of code in the future will be very hard. Thankfully its never too late to refactor! Well I hope... \n\n![refactor](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/dc8d1894-6944-4765-987c-b30ae3c227e3-refactor-time-jp)\n\n## Context\n\n> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.\n\nNow lets see how we can refactor our example to utilise Context API.\n\n",
