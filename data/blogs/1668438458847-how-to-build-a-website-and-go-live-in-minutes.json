  "content": "### Building websites can be hard, but it shouldn't\n\nThere are a few different ways that you can go about building a website. You can either use a website builder, which will allow you to create a website without having to learn any code, or you can learn how to code and build a website from scratch.\n\nIf you want to use a website builder, there are a few different options that you can choose from. Weebly and Wix are two popular website builders that are easy to use and allow you to create a professional looking website without having to learn any code.\n\nIf you want to learn how to code and build a website from scratch, you will need to choose a programming language. HTML and CSS are two of the most popular languages that are used to build websites. Once you have learned how to code in these languages, you will be able to create a website that looks exactly the way that you want it to. \n\nBut hey! We are here to build website fast preferably in minutes. So here is a review of Weebly and Wix! Something that I think is the best tool for the problem!\n\n#### [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com) \nI have used Weebly for a few years now to create websites for my small businesses and have always been happy with the results. The platform is easy to use and has a lot of great features, including the ability to create a blog, an online store, and a members-only area. The only downside is that it can be a bit pricey if you want to use all of the features, but overall it is a great platform for creating a professional website.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Weebly is a very user-friendly platform that is great for those who are not very tech-savvy.\n- There is no need to download or install any software, which makes it very convenient.\n- Weebly offers a wide range of templates and designs that can be used for creating a professional-looking website.\n- The platform provides a drag-and-drop interface that makes it easy to add content and images.\n- Weebly is a very affordable platform, with plans starting at just $4 per month.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Weeblyâ€™s free plan is very limited in terms of features and storage space.\n- The platform does not offer a lot of customization options, which can be a drawback for those who want to create a unique website.\n- Weebly is not as widely used as some of the other website builders, which can make it difficult to find support and resources.\n\n## [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)\nWix is a great website builder that allows you to create a website for free. There are many templates to choose from and you can customize your website to look however you want. You can also add your own photos and videos, and create a blog.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Wix is an extremely user-friendly website builder with a drag-and-drop interface. This makes it ideal for those with no prior experience in web design.\n- Wix offers a wide range of templates and features to choose from, allowing you to create a professional-looking website without having to hire a web designer.\n- Wix is a very affordable website builder, with plans starting at just $5 per month.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Wix websites can be less flexible than those built with other website builders or coding languages, as they are limited to the features and templates offered by Wix.\n- Wix websites may not be compatible with all web browsers and devices.\n- Wix websites may be less search engine friendly than those built with other website builders or coding languages.\n\n### Conclusion\nNo code website builders help build websites fast by allowing users to create and edit web pages without having to write any code. This is especially helpful for those who are not familiar with coding or do not have the time to learn how to code. By using a no code website builder, anyone can create a professional-looking website in a fraction of the time it would take to build one from scratch.",
