However it appears that your first payment method address is set to be your legal address.\n\nSo here are steps to fix this issue.\n\n1. Navigate to google.com or in Google Chrome click account and navigate to \"Manage your Google Account\"\n2. On the left hand navigation open \"Payments and subscriptions\"\n3. In \"Payment methods\" section find and click on link to \"Manage payment methods\"\n4. Navigate to \"Settings\" tab \n5. Find payment profiles and at this point you have 2 options. \n    - Close all profiles that you have and do the same for your family member and then recreate payment profile with the same address\n    - only delete payment profile for your family member, but entering your legal address. \n\nHope that helps!",
