  "content": "What this blog is aiming for is to describe a monorepo solution to make developer experience when working with multiple repos seamless. \n\n## The problem\n\nLet me describe my problem. \n\nI've recently discovered Vendure for my ecommerce project. It had exactly what I wanted. Open source, headless ecommerce CMS with GraphQL API and Admin panel + all extra features you want can be added/extended using plugins. \n\nDocumentation is very good and it also has examples for how to both extend API and Admin UI using plugins. It becomes quite a cumbersome when working with multiple repositories or spinning up developer environment in a separate repos just for a plugin. There is a [template repo](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/plugin-template) for just that. ",
