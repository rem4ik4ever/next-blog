In your terminal type\n```\nnpx create-next-app YOUR_APP_NAME\n```\nThis command will create a folder for your project and ask you if you want to install `Default starter project` or use existing Next.js templates from repository of examples. But we will use `Default starter project`.\n\nIf you don't want to use `create-next-app` just create project directory and run: \n```\nyarn init next-app\nor \nnpm create next-app\n```\nThis will also create a project for you. \n\nNow let's look at the structure of the created project.\n```\n.gitignore\nREADME.md\nnode_modules\npackage.json\npages\npublic\nyarn.lock\n```\n\nLet's go ahead and run a development server. Go to your terminal and type \n```\nyarn dev\n```\nThe default port is set to 3000 and once you navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser you should see\n![Next.js Index page](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets/86034f39-5348-410c-a5fa-04f06455c3b1-450.png)\n\n## Next.js commands\nIf you take a look at `package.json` file you will see that by default you will have 3 commands to run:\n- `dev` - run a development server with development features such as hot reload\n- `build` - creates an optimized production build of your project \n- `start` - run a server. In a production mode based on your recent build\n\n## Pages\nEverything we want to serve on the screen is stored in pages. Let's go ahead and edit existing `pages/index.js` file. \n\nFirst we will erase existing content of the file and add our own.\n```javascript\n const Home = () => {\n   return(\n     <div>\n       <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>\n     </div>\n   )\n }\n\n export default Home;\n```\n\nAlso let's create another page and call it About page in `pages/about.js`\n```javascript\n const About = () => {\n   return(\n     <div>\n       <h1>This page is about me!</h1>\n     </div>\n   )\n }\n\n export default About;\n```\n\nGood, now let's link those pages together and add some routing navigation. For that we will use 'Link' component from `next/link`\n\nadd the following line at the top of the `pages/index.js` and `pages/about.js`\n```javascript\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n```\nLet's update our pages to include links to each other.\n\n\n*_index.js_*\n```javascript\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">Learn more about me!</Link>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Home;\n````\n\n\n*_about.js_*\n```javascript \nimport Link from \"next/link\"\n\n const About = () => {\n   return(\n     <div>\n       <h1>This page is about me!</h1>\n       <Link href=\"/\">Back home</Link>\n     </div>\n   )\n }\n\nexport default About;\n```\n\nNow you should be able to navigate between those pages.\n\n## Routing in Next.js\nAs you might've already understood in Next.js all the routing maps to `pages` folder.\n\n`pages/index.js` => `/` \n`pages/about.js` => `/about`\n\nSay you want to add nested routes, how would you do it? Easy! Let's create 2 new routes:\n`/blog` to list out blogs and `blog/[slug]` to view each individual blogs.\n\nFirst create a folder `blog` inside `pages`, then add 2 files:\n- `index.js` which will map to `/blog` route\n- `[slug].js` which will map to `/blog/your-blog-slug` route\n\nand that's it! \n\nThat's it for our Part 1 setup tour! In the next part we will talk about Static and Dynamic pages and how to pass data to your pages!\n\n\n",
