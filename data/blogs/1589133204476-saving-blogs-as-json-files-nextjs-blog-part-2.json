  "content": "## Welcome to part 2 of Setting up Next.js blog!\nIt is obvious that you need some sort of storage to save your blogs. It could be good old MySQL or Postgres. It could be document storage like  MongoDB, or something new and fancy like FaunaDB. In my case I didn't want to use any third party hosting/provider services to store my data and I also wanted to own data. So, I decided to save files locally and use Github as a data storage. \n\n# CMS\nThere are few things we will cover while building CMS. \n- Writing markdown and rendering markdown blog content\n- Saving/updating files locally using Lambda functions \n- Listing all blogs from files\n- Making sure you can only save/update/delete in development mode locally\n\n## Writing markdown \nI didn't want to write HTML for each blog to style it. So the easiest and right way to do it is to use markdown. \n\nI used package [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown) that allows you to render markdown input as HTML. Now since in my blog I use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) I had to pass renderer function in order for react-markdown package to know how to render each of markdown elements. \n\n\n ![markdown-preview](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/708b2982-d0f6-455c-a8e7-2bcd7cac0498-saving-markdown-)\nFull blog form code [here](https://github.com/rem4ik4ever/next-blog/blob/master/src/cms/blogs/BlogForm.tsx)\n\nThis form allows us to write our blog in textarea as a markdown and then preview it using React Markdown package. We will use the same package to render it in blog page.\n\n## Saving blog file\nWe will be using Lambda functions which is Next.js API routes to save blog. \n\nSending POST request to `/api/cms/blogs` will save file. \n\n![Saving/Listing blog files](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/11e1b90a-63c7-4c97-a203-6fc4f0d7913b-carbon-png)\n[Click here for code](https://github.com/rem4ik4ever/next-blog/blob/master/pages/api/cms/blogs/index.tsx)\n\nFirst of all we need to make sure that incoming request is `POST`, then we check if we are in development environment, by running `devonlyMiddleware` which I will describe later. After that we can proceed with saving file. \n\nHere is example structure of the blog file \n```JSON\n{\n  \"title\": \"Newer draft\",\n  \"tldr\": \"Some tldr\",\n  \"tags\": [],\n  \"content\": \"\",\n  \"thumbnail\": null,\n  \"status\": \"draft\",\n  \"author\": \"Rem Kim\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-15T02:32:45.034Z\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2020-04-22T21:19:19.791Z\",\n  \"slug\": \"newer-draft\",\n  \"id\": 1586917965034\n}\n```\nThose are the fields I find useful and need to be saved. For an ID i used current timestamp. \n\ngenerateFilename \n![generateFilename](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/7df954b6-b97e-4c2d-a706-7c31f455daa1-generate-filenam)\n\ngetSlug \n![getSlug](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/56430dd5-ed3f-4771-b1e2-e457e307ceca-getslug-png)\n\nand finally saveBlogFile\n![saveBlogFile](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets/91ee5a00-2fd2-42ce-b985-a23b6f431314-500.png)\n\nI used `fileSystem.promises` in order to be able to use async/await syntax.\n\n## Update/Find blog\n\nNow, in order to find or update blog by its ID, i've added another api route\n`api/cms/blogs/[id]`\n![save-find](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets/f0a5185c-b5ab-484e-a326-b260f56ca17b-600.png)\n[Click to see code](https://github.com/rem4ik4ever/next-blog/blob/master/pages/api/cms/blogs/%5Bid%5D.tsx)\n\nallFiles - This function will scan directory with blog files, reach each one and parse its content to JSON, then output array of blog objects.\n![allFiles](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets/6891a6a7-fc1b-4ccc-b8eb-e42ce5ecb633-600.png)\n\nwriteJSONToFile and makeFilename\n![write-and-make-filename](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets/a4c3f9f1-010a-4c13-8458-c66e8edb7447-600.png)\n\n## devonlyMiddleware\nI promised we will comeback to this one. Like I said before I want to be able to use all that functionality locally when spinning up local development server. However on production those api functions should error out. \n\nIn order to do it I've added `devonlyMiddleware` \n![devonlyMIddleware](https://rem-blog-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets/b99248db-4a01-4dcf-9bf2-081075a0bc47-600.png)\n\n\n## Conclusion\nNow with those API routes, I can read/save/update blogs and github becomes my data storage.
